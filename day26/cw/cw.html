    <h1>The Importance of Preserving Old Buildings</h1>
    <p>
      Of course a city should preserve its old, historic buildings. New buildings can always be built, but old ones can never be replaced. 
      They are usually more beautiful than modern buildings, they represent the city’s history, and they can even help the city by attracting tourists. 
      Historic buildings should always be preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old buildings are usually very beautiful. Depending on when they were built, they show different periods of architecture. 
      They have a lot of character. They were made by hand, the old-fashioned way. You can feel the personalities of the people who built them 
      and of the people who have lived and worked in them. Modern buildings, on the other hand, are usually not so beautiful. 
      They seem like impersonal giants that have no character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old buildings represent a city’s history. Important things may have taken place in an old building. Maybe a peace treaty was signed there 
      or an important meeting took place. A famous person may have lived there. Maybe it was a former president or a famous writer. 
      When we have historic buildings around us, we learn more about our history and we appreciate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old buildings attract tourists to a city. People want to see buildings because they are beautiful or because important things happened in them. 
      If a city has a lot of old, interesting buildings, many tourists will visit the city. That is good for the city’s economy. 
      People usually don’t visit a city in order to see its modern buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A city’s old, historic buildings are among its greatest treasures. They are a source of beauty and a representation of history. 
      It would be a crime to try to replace them.
