<p>A dual-sport motorcycle is a type of motorcycle that is designed for varying degrees of off-road use while still being street-legal. Dual-sports are equipped with lights, a speedometer, mirrors, a horn, registration plates, turn signals, and a muffler with spark arrestor and decibel noise output to comply with government regulations. They vary considerably in engine size and weight, though they are typically 510cc or smaller. They are often versions of off-road bikes that have been made legal for street driving. [1]

Other names such as all-road, on/off-road, dual-purpose, and adventure bike may be chosen by the manufacturer based upon the size, weight, and intended application of the motorcycle. Typically the dual sport category weighs less than 400 pounds/180 kilos to make them more comfortable and capable off-road, while adventure bikes are more than 400 pounds/180 kilos to make them more comfortable and capable on the pavement.</p>
